# Sprint 001: xt_asn Project Modernization and Infrastructure

## Sprint Goal
Modernize the xt_asn iptables module project by updating documentation, adding build systems, implementing testing, and creating Debian/Ubuntu packaging.

## Sprint Duration
Estimated: 5-7 days

## Background
The xt_asn project is an iptables module that works with ASN lists from BGP AS and can determine the country for IP address ranges. The project needs modernization to improve maintainability, testability, and distribution.

## Current State Analysis
- **Technology Stack**: C kernel module + userspace library, autotools build system
- **Target Platforms**: Linux kernel 3.7+, tested on RockyLinux 8.6
- **Features**: 
  - Support for 4-byte ASN (improved from original 2-byte ASN support)
  - IPv4 and IPv6 support
  - BGP data processing from RouteViews.org
  - Binary search for efficient IP range matching

## Sprint Backlog

### 1. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Modernize README.md with better structure and examples
- [ ] Create comprehensive installation guide
- [ ] Add API documentation for developers
- [ ] Document build process and dependencies
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

### 2. Build System Improvements  
- [ ] Update autotools configuration for modern systems
- [ ] Add CMake alternative build system
- [ ] Improve dependency detection
- [ ] Add build configuration options
- [ ] Create build scripts for different platforms

### 3. Testing Framework
- [ ] Design unit test framework for kernel module
- [ ] Implement userspace library tests
- [ ] Add integration tests for BGP data processing
- [ ] Create mock data for testing
- [ ] Add continuous testing setup

### 4. Debian/Ubuntu Packaging
- [ ] Create debian/ directory structure
- [ ] Write control files and dependencies
- [ ] Create installation/removal scripts
- [ ] Add systemd service files for BGP data updates
- [ ] Test package installation on multiple Ubuntu/Debian versions

### 5. Code Quality & CI/CD
- [ ] Add static analysis tools
- [ ] Implement coding standards enforcement
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions/GitLab CI pipeline
- [ ] Add automated testing on multiple platforms
- [ ] Set up automated releases

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
- [ ] Build system works on Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, and Debian 11, 12
- [ ] Test suite passes with >80% coverage
- [ ] Debian packages can be built and installed successfully
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs all tests and builds packages automatically
- [ ] Code quality metrics meet established standards

## Dependencies & Requirements
- Linux kernel headers
- iptables development libraries
- autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool)
- gcc compiler
- bgpdump utility
- perl with Net::IP and Net::Netmask modules

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Kernel compatibility**: Test on multiple kernel versions
- **Build complexity**: Provide clear documentation and error messages
- **BGP data format changes**: Add validation and error handling

## Success Metrics
- Successful builds on target platforms: 100%
- Documentation completeness score: >90%
- Test coverage: >80%
- Package installation success rate: 100%
